<p>My name is Rudi, second-year student in Computer Science at University of Waterloo and this is my personal blog where I will post my projects, comments about tech, math, random tidbits that might be useful, random tidbits that might not be useful but hopefully interesting.</p>

A random fact about myself? I practice pen spinning (look it up if you've never hear that term!) and [have once appeared on national television](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5SxsDS0fHk). I'm not one of the best out there, but I know quite a few tricks.

I'm also a Microsoft Student Partner at University of Waterloo, so I'm your contact guy for any questions you might have regarding app development, Imagine Cup, getting free Microsoft software, etc.

Feel free to contact me at any time! Email at either **rudi.chen@studentpartner.com** for Microsoft and developer related questions and comments, or at **rudichen@gmail.com** for anything else.
