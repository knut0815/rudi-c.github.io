<p>My name is Rudi, second-year student in Computer Science at University of Waterloo and this is my personal blog where I will post my projects, comments about tech, math, random tidbits that might be useful, random tidbits that might not be useful but hopefully interesting.</p>

A random fact about myself? I practice pen spinning (look it up if you've never hear that term!) and [have once appeared on national television](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5SxsDS0fHk). I'm not one of the best out there, but I know quite a few tricks.

Feel free to contact me at any time! Email at **rudichen@gmail.com**.

Reading List
============
<center>*some subset of it*</center>

News/Magazines
--------------

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for a daily selection of interesting links relevant in the tech industry, and for being the only website where the comments on an article are occasionally more insightful than the article itself.

[The Verge](http://theverge.com/) for an aggregation of tech news, as well as occasional random interesting articles about science, media, etc. Like Hacker News, but more like a regular news site.

[Google News](https://news.google.com/) for most non-tech news stories.

[Anandtech](http://www.anandtech.com/) occasionally when I'm in the mood to be a hardware geek.
