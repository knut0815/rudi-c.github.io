> Rudi's personal story: In my first two years of university, I was really into building side projects. I was plan
ning around how to fit projects into my spare time a few months in advance. Eventually after 2 internships, that s
tarted winding down. In the second half of my time at Waterloo, I started spending more time exploring cities and
socializing. I got into DDR and Rock Climbing. I travelled a bbit and learned to meet and talk to people from all
kinds of different backgrounds. I got interested in public speaking. These have been very important for my persona
l growth and getting my life in order. Now, as I graduate, I'm slowly getting back into side projects again.

> Some people do the opposite route: they get all sorts of life experience and meet tons of new people. They get t
heir life in order and then catch up on all the technical stuff. Neither approach is better than the other: the gr
eat thing about life is that there's so many paths to success.
