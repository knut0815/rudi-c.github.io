My name is Rudi, a student in Computer Science at University of Waterloo and this is my personal blog where I will post my projects, comments about tech, math, random tidbits that might be useful, random tidbits that might not be useful but hopefully interesting.

My 'programmer archetype' is one that has one foot in academia, one foot in industry, and my projects are often at the intersection of both. I see coding as a craft to be perfected: this includes design, understandability, brevity, and performance. I've written [apps](http://fractalphotographer.com/) and aim for polish. I value having strong fundamentals: math, algorithms, systems, tools.

In terms of computer science topics, my interests move around a lot. Lately, they have been 3D graphics and compilers. In the past, the kind of stuff I've enjoyed include neural networks, image processing, data visualization. I also enjoy getting a wide exposure to different types of programming languages, including ones like F#, Rust.

Random fact: I practice pen spinning (look it up if you've never hear of that term!) and [have once appeared on national television](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5SxsDS0fHk). I'm not one of the best out there, but I know quite a few tricks.
