<p><em>This blog post explains the philosophy behind some of the decisions I make, in particular the ones involved in my past and potential successes, in a broad sense.</p>
<p>It seems like a funny topic for a first-year undergraduate student to write about. I'm unproven. I've done reasonably well so far, but I don't have flabbergasting achievements. Without proper qualifications, everything here could be wrong.</p>
<p>And perhaps that is what I'm hoping for - for someone to correct me if I'm wrong. Or to give helpful advice if I'm right since, after all, I'm only the product of the advice that has been given to me.</em></p>
