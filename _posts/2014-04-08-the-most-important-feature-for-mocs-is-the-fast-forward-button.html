<p>Fast forwards helps keep attention</p>
<p>Difference between MOCs and normal curriculum is that normal curriculum can make more assumptions on the current skill level and knowledge of the student (not always true especially for 1st year, but is a reasonable assumption). Can chain courses together whereas MOCs have smaller chains and a bit more scattered random topics. Rarely the course will contain only material that is both new and at the right level. More likely, there is a bunch of known material and a bunch of too hard material. I think most people are better off with the easier course that has more known material than too hard material. But don't want to just skip the known material, what if there is actually something new? A new piece of syntax, perhaps. Sure, you can look up the syntax, but it's easy to go through tons of lectures without understanding a crucial element. Also, looking up the syntax doesn't explain the "why".</p>
