<p>I found this out somewhat randomly. Though so far I have still been averaging 30 downloads a day, about what I would expect from a fractal app (not many people even know what that word means), it's still nice that someone ranked Fractal Photographer #6. On the other hand, the number of downloads should be increasing veryyy soon :</p>
