<p>I usually don't typeset my notes for a whole course, but as the rest of this website indicates, fractals are one of my favorite topics, this is the only course I am taking this term (I'm doing research full-time in Computational Photography) and this course (PMATH 370 - Chaos and Fractals) is only offered once every two years.</p>
