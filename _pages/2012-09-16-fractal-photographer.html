<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Fractal are mathematical shapes found in nature. They have certain properties, such as self-similarity: no matter how deep you zoom, you can find copies of itself. This app generates the Mandelbrot Set, the most complex and beautiful of all fractals. The above is just one of infinitely many different spots that you can find. There are treasures to be found everywhere along the border of the set.</span></p>

There are many different ways of navigating - pinch-zoom-rotate, scroll-wheel, buttons, double-click/tap on a particular spot, rotation interface, etc. Pick whatever suits your needs best.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The program does all the number crunching for you, but the vibrant colors will be what makes your particular picture outshine all others. Fortunately, the color picker will generate thumbnails that preview what a particular spot would look like as you explore. This way, you can immediately choose the most fitting color scheme at a glance.</span></p>
