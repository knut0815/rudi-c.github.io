**Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns**: I went through a phase of 'OOP is king!' once, before I discovered there were more approaches than computing than just using objects, which isn't always the most suited tool. <a>http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ca/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html</a>

**How and Why to Granularize**. One of the most important life skills is to learn how to learn, and a large part of that is knowing how to learn a difficult skill by breaking it down in subskills and mastering each in turn.

News/Magazines
--------------

I periodically take a look at these.

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for a daily selection of interesting links relevant in the tech industry, and for being the only website where the comments on an article are occasionally more insightful than the article itself.

[The Verge](http://theverge.com/) for an aggregation of tech news, as well as occasional random interesting articles about science, media, etc. Like Hacker News, but more like a regular news site.

[Quartz](http://qz.com/) they have good non-tech articles.

[Google News](https://news.google.com/) for most non-tech news stories.

[Anandtech](http://www.anandtech.com/) occasionally when I'm in the mood to be a hardware geek.

[Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/)

[Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) no longer active, but tons of timeless articles.

[Paul Graham's Essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)

[The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)

[TripleByte Blog](http://blog.triplebyte.com/) has interesting research on categorizing the strengths of different kinds of engineers and placing them where they fit best.

A lot of Quora. I spend way too much time on that site.

Speaking of books, I was also a reviewer for [Mastering Leap Motion](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Leap-Motion-Brandon-Sanders/dp/1783551399).
